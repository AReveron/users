Webauthn Two-Factor Authentication
----------------------------------
It's required the version 4.4 of web-auth/webauthn-lib to use webauthn
two-factor authentication. The main actions behave the same as before,
if you had extended the adapter please check the following changes:
 - `Webauthn\Server` was removed from web-auth/webauthn-lib and the related
 logic was migrated into our custom classes `\CakeDC\Users\Webauthn\AuthenticateAdapter`
and `\CakeDC\Users\Webauthn\RegisterAdapter`
 - Removed protected method `\CakeDC\Users\Webauthn\AuthenticateAdapter::loadAndCheckAssertionResponse`, this method was
related to `Webauthn\Server`
 - Removed protected method `\CakeDC\Users\Webauthn\RegisterAdapter::loadAndCheckAttestationResponse`, this method was
   related to `Webauthn\Server`
 - Added class `\CakeDC\Users\Webauthn\Base64Utility` to provide basic encoding and decoding compatible with previous versions.
 - Added class `\CakeDC\Users\Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialLoader` to correctly load credentials from basic
client (javascript) provided.
